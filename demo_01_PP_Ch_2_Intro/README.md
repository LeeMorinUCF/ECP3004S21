# Hello, Python

Python is a language of choice for data science and business analytics. 
It is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose computer programming language. 
We define all of these terms in what follows. 



## What is a computer?

At a basic level, a *computer* is a list of *information stored in memory*, combined with some *operations* that can be performed on the information in memory.
At any time, a computer has a state that is defined by the set of values at each of the locations in memory.


## What is a program?

A *computer program* is a *list of instructions* for operations to be performed on the values stored in memory.
A program alters the state of the computer.


## How do computers run programs?

The human-readable computer program that you write is *interpreted*, or translated into another set of instructions, by another program called the interpreter.
This interpreter translates the program into something that will run on the operating system.
The operating system, such as Windows, Linux or Mac OS, is another set of programs that then translate your instructions into a more primitive set of instructions that are finally executed on the computer.

Why go through all of this trouble? Well, first, the operating system uncouples your program from the particulars of the hardware on your physical computer, such as the monitor, the hard drive and the keyboard.
Further, the interpreter separates the instructions in your program from the particular operating system on your computer.
With this separation, you need only write the instructions in standardized syntax and the interpreter and operating system take care of the rest.

To say that python is a *high-level language* is to say that there are several levels of interpretation between the python script that you type and the operations that are actually run on the computer. 
This form of computing is often slower to run but faster to code. 
In comparison, languages such as C++ or Fortran are low-level languages that are slower to code, must be compiled before running, instead of interpreted as they run, but run much faster. 
Python is known to have a flatter learning curve that these low-level languages but, as a general-purpose language, the learning curve is steeper than that for languages such as R, which are designed for specific purposes.
